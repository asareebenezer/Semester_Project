Introduction

The Vodafone Cash Management System is a command-line program that simulates basic functionalities of a Vodafone Cash account. Users can register their account, login, send money, withdraw cash, buy airtime or data, and change their PIN. The program uses a text-based interface for interaction.
Features

   - Registration: Users can register their Vodafone Cash account by providing personal information such as first name, last name, nationality, gender, and address. The registration details are saved to a file named "Reg_User.txt".

    -Login: Users can log in using their registered username and PIN. A default PIN is provided for initial login, and users can change their PIN later.

    -Money Transfer: Users can send money to another mobile number within the system. The recipient's mobile number is confirmed, and the sender's balance is updated accordingly.

    -Cash Withdrawal: Users can withdraw cash from their Vodafone Cash account either through an agent or a bank. The user's balance is adjusted accordingly.

    -Airtime and Data Purchase: Users can buy airtime or data for themselves or others. The user's balance is deducted based on the purchased amount.

    -PIN Change: Users can change their PIN for added security.
